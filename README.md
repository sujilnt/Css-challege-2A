These challenges are here to help you flex your CSS skills, and see where you need to practise more! If you're new to CSS, You can clone my project and see.

#CSS Challenge 2 â€“ Shakespeare's Sonnet
This second challenge will help you to re-cap your CSS text formatting skills, as well as start using margins and padding. Copy-n-paste the HTML to get started, and click on the image to see what your page should look like!

If you can improve on the design (shouldn't be too hard!) without increasing the difficulty of this challenge, great! I'll happily replace the image!

Hints:

The thumbnails are not very representative, but this challenge requires you to create a fixed-width layout that is centred in the browser window. <br>
Click on an image for a closer view.
Hint 2: to get the wrap division to stay centred, you'll need to set the left and right margins to a_t_ (you've got to fill in the blanks).

      <h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18</h1>
      <p>
         This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced
         in the film Dead Poets Society and gave names to the band The
         Darling Buds and the book and television series The Darling Buds
         of May. Read it and weep!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
        <li>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
        <li>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
        <li>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</li>
        <li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
        <li>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</li>
        <li>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
        <li>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</li>
        <li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
        <li>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
        <li>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</li>
        <li>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</li>
        <li>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</li>
        <li>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
      </ul>
